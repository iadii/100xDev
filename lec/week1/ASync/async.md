# Asynchronous Programming;

Async programming lets tasks run concurrently rather than one after the other. It improves efficiency by allowing a program to perform other operations while waiting for time-consuming tasks, like I/O operations, to finish. This helps in making applications more responsive and better at handling multiple tasks simultaneously.
